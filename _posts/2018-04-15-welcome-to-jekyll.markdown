As usual, when begining with a new project, we (developers) starts with “Hello, World!” expression!

This time, a new blog has born, and will be a new challange because I choosed [Jekyll][jekyll-site] as a tool to manage and serve the static content.

![Jekyll Logo](/assets/img/logo-jekyll.png)

I will post technical and non-technical content, and maybe personal thoughts...

Multilanguage content (at least in portuguese, spanish, and english) should be expected! Just to force me to write, exercise and improve my writings in other languages.

Finally, I want you to be patient, I need to learn this new technology stack to improve step by step this blog.

And if you asking: why the name is "One Frag Left!" ?
Just because that's the name of my first blog, you can find it at [blogpost][jfunez-blogspot]

Hope you enjoy it!
